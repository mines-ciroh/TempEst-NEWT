    "# Coefficient Estimation for NEWT\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have established that, with the available periods-of-record, a stationary SCHEMA works quite well, though some sort of dynamism is likely to help with longer-range applications.  Still, the emphasis is on short-term and S2S forecasting, so long-range efficiency isn't critical (and, more to the point, can be returned to later).  Now, let's look at coefficient estimation, where dynamic fitting is likely to be more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic idea.  We want to be able to run a watershed model without pre-feeding years of data, but we also want to benefit from data on atmospheric conditions.  How should we proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop one fit for model coefficients based only on static surface conditions (XYZ, slope and aspect, land cover/LAI, drainage area)\n",
    "- Develop a separate fit for model coefficients based only on dynamic conditions (mean precipitation, temperature, and humidity; land cover/LAI again; soil moisture; aridity)\n",
    "- Tune two \"drift rates\": climate drift (rate of convergence from static-only to climate-only; possibly with a final equilibrium weighting), and recency weight (weighting of climate over time, controlling speed of correction for climate shifts)\n",
    "\n",
    "For early reporting, I will prototype this with a single model accounting for all data.  Then, I'll build a static-only watershed model generator and a climate-drift model modification engine for the final implementation.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Weather data (have)\n",
    "- Land cover/LAI (need)\n",
